The alpha2adrenergic receptors are a type of adrenergic receptors (for adrenaline or epinephrine), which inhibit adenylate cyclase. These receptors include 3 highly homologous subtypes: alpha2A, alpha2B, and alpha2C. They are involved in regulating the release of neurotransmitter molecules from sympathetic nerves and from adrenergic neurons in the central nervous system.

Catalysis involves both the formation of a 2',5' phosphodiester linkage at the GpA step and the formation of a 3',5' phosphodiester linkage at the ApG step, producing c[G(2',5')pA(3',5')p] . Acts as a key DNA sensor: directly binds doublestranded DNA (dsDNA), inducing the formation of liquidlike droplets in which CGAS is activated, leading to synthesis of 2',3'cGAMP, a second messenger that binds to and activates STING1, thereby triggering typeI interferon production . Preferentially recognizes and binds curved long dsDNAs of a minimal length of 40 bp . Acts as a key foreign DNA sensor, the presence of doublestranded DNA (dsDNA) in the cytoplasm being a danger signal that triggers the immune responses . Has antiviral activity by sensing the presence of dsDNA from DNA viruses in the cytoplasm . Also acts as an innate immune sensor of infection by retroviruses, such as HIV2, by detecting the presence of reversetranscribed DNA in the cytosol . In contrast, HIV1 is poorly sensed by CGAS, due to its capsid that cloaks viral DNA from CGAS detection . Detection of retroviral reverse transcribed DNA in the cytosol may be indirect and be mediated via interaction with PQBP1, which directly binds reversetranscribed retroviral DNA . Also detects the presence of DNA from bacteria, such as M.tuberculosis . 2',3'cGAMP can be transferred from producing cells to neighboring cells through gap junctions, leading to promote STING1 activation and convey immune response to connecting cells . 2',3'cGAMP can also be transferred between cells by virtue of packaging within viral particles contributing to IFNinduction in newly infected cells in a cGAS independent but STING1dependent manner . Also senses the presence of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that are translocated to the cytosol following phagocytosis, leading to synthesis of 2',3'cGAMP . In addition to foreign DNA, can also be activated by endogenous nuclear or mitochondrial DNA . When selfDNA leaks into the cytosol during cellular stress (such as mitochondrial stress, SARSCoV2 infection causing severe COVID19 disease, DNA damage, mitotic arrest or senescence), or is present in form of cytosolic micronuclei, CGAS is activated leading to a state of sterile inflammation . Acts as a regulator of cellular senescence by binding to cytosolic chromatin fragments that are present in senescent cells, leading to trigger typeI interferon production via STING1 and promote cellular senescence . Also involved in the inflammatory response to genome instability and doublestranded DNA breaks: acts by localizing to micronuclei arising from genome instability . Micronuclei, which are frequently found in cancer cells, consist of chromatin surrounded by their own nuclear membrane: following breakdown of the micronuclear envelope, a process associated with chromothripsis, CGAS binds selfDNA exposed to the cytosol, leading to 2',3'cGAMP synthesis and subsequent activation of STING1 and typeI interferon production . Activated in response to prolonged mitotic arrest, promoting mitotic cell death . In a healthy cell, CGAS is however kept inactive even in cellular events that directly expose it to selfDNA, such as mitosis, when cGAS associates with chromatin directly after nuclear envelope breakdown or remains in the form of postmitotic persistent nuclear cGAS pools bound to chromatin . Nuclear CGAS is inactivated by chromatin via direct interaction with nucleosomes, which block CGAS from DNA binding and thus prevent CGASinduced autoimmunity . Also acts as a suppressor of DNA repair in response to DNA damage: inhibits homologous recombination repair by interacting with PARP1, the CGASPARP1 interaction leading to impede the formation of the PARP1TIMELESS complex . In addition to DNA, also sense translation stress: in response to translation stress, translocates to the cytosol and associates with collided ribosomes, promoting its activation and triggering typeI interferon production . In contrast to other mammals, human CGAS displays speciesspecific mechanisms of DNA recognition and produces less 2',3'cGAMP, allowing a more finetuned response to pathogens ."

HSPA1B,Soluble,1,"This intronless gene encodes a 70kDa heat shock protein which is a member of the heat shock protein 70 family. In conjuction with other heat shock proteins, this protein stabilizes existing proteins against aggregation and mediates the folding of newly translated proteins in the cytosol and in organelles. It is also involved in the ubiquitinproteasome pathway through interaction with the AUrich element RNAbinding protein 1. The gene is located in the major histocompatibility complex class III region, in a cluster with two closely related genes which encode similar proteins. Molecular chaperone implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes, including protection of the proteome from stress, folding and transport of newly synthesized polypeptides, activation of proteolysis of misfolded proteins and the formation and dissociation of protein complexes. Plays a pivotal role in the protein quality control system, ensuring the correct folding of proteins, the refolding of misfolded proteins and controlling the targeting of proteins for subsequent degradation. This is achieved through cycles of ATP binding, ATP hydrolysis and ADP release, mediated by cochaperones. The co chaperones have been shown to not only regulate different steps of the ATPase cycle, but they also have an individual specificity such that one cochaperone may promote folding of a substrate while another may promote degradation. The affinity for polypeptides is regulated by its nucleotide bound state. In the ATPbound form, it has a low affinity for substrate proteins. However, upon hydrolysis of the ATP to ADP, it undergoes a conformational change that increases its affinity for substrate proteins. It goes through repeated cycles of ATP hydrolysis and nucleotide exchange, which permits cycles of substrate binding and release. The cochaperones are of three types: Jdomain cochaperones such as HSP40s (stimulate ATPase hydrolysis by HSP70), the nucleotide exchange factors (NEF) such as BAG1/2/3 (facilitate conversion of HSP70 from the ADPbound to the ATPbound state thereby promoting substrate release), and the TPR domain chaperones such as HOPX and STUB1 . Maintains protein homeostasis during cellular stress through two opposing mechanisms: protein refolding and degradation. Its acetylation/deacetylation state determines whether it functions in protein refolding or protein degradation by controlling the competitive binding of cochaperones HOPX and STUB1. During the early stress response, the acetylated form binds to HOPX which assists in chaperonemediated protein refolding, thereafter, it is deacetylated and binds to ubiquitin ligase STUB1 that promotes ubiquitinmediated protein degradation . Regulates centrosome integrity during mitosis, and is required for the maintenance of a functional mitotic centrosome that supports the assembly of a bipolar mitotic spindle . Enhances STUB1mediated SMAD3 ubiquitination and degradation and facilitates STUB1mediated inhibition of TGFbeta signaling .

Variations in this gene have been linked to metabolic syndrome. Guanine nucleotidebinding protein (G protein) alpha subunit playing a prominent role in bitter and sweet taste transduction as well as in umami (monosodium glutamate, monopotassium glutamate, and inosine monophosphate) taste transduction. Transduction by this alpha subunit involves coupling of specific cellsurface receptors with a cGMP phosphodiesterase; Activation of phosphodiesterase lowers intracellular levels of cAMP and cGMP which may open a cyclic nucleotidesuppressible cation channel leading to influx of calcium, ultimately leading to release of neurotransmitter.

IL27,Soluble,1,"The protein encoded by this gene is one of the subunits of a heterodimeric cytokine complex. This protein is related to interleukin 12A (IL12A). It interacts with EpsteinBarr virus induced gene 3 (EBI3), a protein similar to interleukin 12B (IL12B), and forms a complex that has been shown to drive rapid expansion of naive but not memory CD4(+) T cells. The complex is also found to synergize strongly with interleukin 12 to trigger interferon gamma (IFNG) production of naive CD4(+) T cells. The biological effects of this cytokine are mediated by the class I cytokine receptor (WSX1/TCRR). Associates with EBI3 to form the IL27 interleukin, a heterodimeric cytokine which functions in innate immunity. IL27 has pro and antiinflammatory properties, that can regulate Thelper cell development, suppress Tcell proliferation, stimulate cytotoxic Tcell activity, induce isotype switching in Bcells, and that has diverse effects on innate immune cells. Among its target cells are CD4 Thelper cells which can differentiate in type 1 effector cells (TH1), type 2 effector cells (TH2) and IL17 producing helper Tcells (TH17). It drives rapid clonal expansion of naive but not memory CD4 Tcells. It also strongly synergizes with IL12 to trigger interferongamma/IFN gamma production of naive CD4 Tcells, binds to the cytokine receptor WSX1/TCCR which appears to be required but not sufficient for IL27 mediated signal transduction. IL27 potentiate the early phase of TH1 response and suppress TH2 and TH17 differentiation. It induces the differentiation of TH1 cells via two distinct pathways, p38 MAPK/TBX21 and ICAM1/ITGAL/ERKdependent pathways. It also induces STAT1, STAT3, STAT4 and STAT5 phosphorylation and activates TBX21/TBet via STAT1 with resulting IL12RB2 upregulation, an event crucial to TH1 cell commitment. It suppresses the expression of GATA3, the inhibitor TH1 cells development. In CD8 Tcells, it activates STATs as well as GZMB. IL27 reveals to be a potent inhibitor of TH17 cell development and of IL17 production. Indeed IL27 alone is also able to inhibit the production of IL17 by CD4 and CD8 Tcells. While IL27 suppressed the development of proinflammatory Th17 cells via STAT1, it inhibits the development of antiinflammatory inducible regulatory Tcells, iTreg, independently of STAT1. IL27 has also an effect on cytokine production, it suppresses proinflammatory cytokine production such as IL2, IL4, IL5 and IL6 and activates suppressors of cytokine signaling such as SOCS1 and SOCS3. Apart from suppression of cytokine production, IL27 also antagonizes the effects of some cytokines such as IL6 through direct effects on Tcells. Another important role of IL27 is its antitumor activity as well as its antiangiogenic activity with activation of production of antiangiogenic chemokines such as IP 10/CXCL10 and MIG/CXCL9. In vein endothelial cells, it induces IRF1/interferon regulatory factor 1 and increase the expression of MHC class II transactivator/CIITA with resulting upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class II.

PLG,Soluble,1,"The plasminogen protein encoded by this gene is a serine protease that circulates in blood plasma as an inactive zymogen and is converted to the active protease, plasmin, by several plasminogen activators such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), kallikrein, and factor XII (Hageman factor). The conversion of plasminogen to plasmin involves the cleavage of the peptide bond between Arg561 and Val562. Plasmin cleavage also releases the angiostatin protein which inhibits angiogenesis. Plasmin degrades many blood plasma proteins, including fibrincontaining blood clots. As a serine protease, plasmin cleaves many products in addition to fibrin such as fibronectin, thrombospondin, laminin, and von Willebrand factor. Plasmin is inactivated by proteins such as alpha2macroglobulin and alpha2antiplasmin in addition to inhibitors of the various plasminogen activators. Plasminogen also interacts with plasminogen receptors which results in the retention of plasmin on cell surfaces and in plasmininduced cell signaling. The localization of plasminogen on cell surfaces plays a role in the degradation of extracellular matrices, cell migration, inflamation, wound healing, oncogenesis, metastasis, myogenesis, muscle regeneration, neurite outgrowth, and fibrinolysis.
