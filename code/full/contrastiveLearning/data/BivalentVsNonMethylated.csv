Gene name,StrLabel,Label,Summary
KCNMA1,NonMethylated,1," Potassium channel activated by both membrane depolarization or increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) that mediates export of K(+) . It is also activated by the concentration of cytosolic Mg(2+). Its activation dampens the excitatory events that elevate the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration and/or depolarize the cell membrane. It therefore contributes to repolarization of the membrane potential. Plays a key role in controlling excitability in a number of systems, such as regulation of the contraction of smooth muscle, the tuning of hair cells in the cochlea, regulation of transmitter release, and innate immunity. In smooth muscles, its activation by high level of Ca(2+), caused by ryanodine receptors in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, regulates the membrane potential. In cochlea cells, its number and kinetic properties partly determine the characteristic frequency of each hair cell and thereby helps to establish a tonotopic map. Kinetics of KCNMA1 channels are determined by alternative splicing, phosphorylation status and its combination with modulating beta subunits.

The protein is made as a precursor that is autocatalytically cleaved; the Nterminal portion is soluble and contains the signalling activity while the Cterminal portion is involved in precursor processing. More importantly, the Cterminal product covalently attaches a cholesterol moiety to the Nterminal product, restricting the Nterminal product to the cell surface and preventing it from freely diffusing throughout the developing embryo.

Required for overt chondrogenesis when condensed prechondrocytes differentiate into early stage chondrocytes: SOX5 and SOX6 cooperatively bind with SOX9 on active enhancers and superenhancers associated with cartilagespecific genes, and thereby potentiate SOX9's ability to transactivate. Not involved in precartilaginous condensation, the first step in chondrogenesis, during which skeletal progenitors differentiate into prechondrocytes. Together with SOX5, required to form and maintain a pool of highly proliferating chondroblasts between epiphyses and metaphyses, to form columnar chondroblasts, delay chondrocyte prehypertrophy but promote hypertrophy, and to delay terminal differentiation of chondrocytes on contact with ossification fronts. Binds to the proximal promoter region of the myelin protein MPZ gene, and is thereby involved in the differentiation of oligodendroglia in the developing spinal tube. Binds to the gene promoter of MBP and acts as a transcriptional repressor ."
KLK7,NonMethylated,1,"This gene encodes a member of the kallikrein subfamily of serine proteases. These enzymes have diverse physiological functions and many kallikrein genes are biomarkers for cancer. The encoded protein has chymotrypsinlike activity and plays a role in the proteolysis of intercellular cohesive structures that precedes desquamation, the shedding of the outermost layer of the epidermis. The encoded protein may play a role in cancer invasion and metastasis, and increased expression of this gene is associated with unfavorable prognosis and progression of several types of cancer. Polymorphisms in this gene may play a role in the development of atopic dermatitis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene, which is one of fifteen kallikrein subfamily members located in a gene cluster on chromosome 19. May catalyze the degradation of intercellular cohesive structures in the cornified layer of the skin in the continuous shedding of cells from the skin surface. Specific for amino acid residues with aromatic side chains in the P1 position. Cleaves insulin A chain at '14Tyr|Gln15' and insulin B chain at '6Leu|Cys7', '16Tyr|Leu17', '25Phe|Tyr26' and '26Tyr|Thr27'. Could play a role in the activation of precursors to inflammatory cytokines."
SOX6,Bivalent,0,"This region represents the proximal promoter of the SRYbox 6 (SOX6) gene. This promoter is autoregulated by binding of SOX6 protein to a conserved element in this sequence. Transcription factor that plays a key role in several developmental processes, including neurogenesis, chondrocytes differentiation and cartilage formation (Probable). Specifically binds the 5'AACAAT3' DNA motif present in enhancers and superenhancers and promotes expression of genes important for chondrogenesis.

PAX1,Bivalent,0,This gene is a member of the paired box (PAX) family of transcription factors. Members of the PAX family typically contain a paired box domain and a pairedtype homeodomain. These genes play critical roles during fetal development. This gene plays a role in pattern formation during embryogenesis and may be essential for development of the vertebral column. This gene is silenced by methylation in ovarian and cervical cancers and may be a tumor suppressor gene. Mutations in this gene are also associated with vertebral malformations. This protein is a transcriptional activator. It may play a role in the formation of segmented structures of the embryo. May play an important role in the normal development of the vertebral column .
SIX2,Bivalent,0,"This gene is a member of the vertebrate gene family which encode proteins homologous to the Drosophila 'sine oculis' homeobox protein. The encoded protein is a transcription factor which, like other members of this gene family, may be involved in limb or eye development. Transcription factor that plays an important role in the development of several organs, including kidney, skull and stomach. During kidney development, maintains cap mesenchyme multipotent nephron progenitor cells in an undifferentiated state by opposing the inductive signals emanating from the ureteric bud and cooperates with WNT9B to promote renewing progenitor cells proliferation. Acts through its interaction with TCF7L2 and OSR1 in a canonical Wnt signaling independent manner preventing transcription of differentiation genes in cap mesenchyme such as WNT4. Also acts independently of OSR1 to activate expression of many cap mesenchyme genes, including itself, GDNF and OSR1. During craniofacial development plays a role in growth and elongation of the cranial base through regulation of chondrocyte differentiation. During stomach organogenesis, controls pyloric sphincter formation and mucosal growth through regulation of a gene network including NKX25, BMPR1B, BMP4, SOX9 and GREM1. During branchial arch development, acts to mediate HOXA2 control over the insulinlike growth factor pathway. May also be involved in limb tendon and ligament development . Plays a role in cell proliferation and migration."
SATB1,Bivalent,0,"This gene encodes a matrix protein which binds nuclear matrix and scaffoldassociating DNAs through a unique nuclear architecture. The protein recruits chromatinremodeling factors in order to regulate chromatin structure and gene expression. rucial silencing factor contributing to the initiation of X inactivation mediated by Xist RNA that occurs during embryogenesis and in lymphoma . Binds to DNA at special ATrich sequences, the consensus SATB1binding sequence (CSBS), at nuclear matrix or scaffoldassociated regions. Thought to recognize the sugarphosphate structure of doublestranded DNA. Transcriptional repressor controlling nuclear and viral gene expression in a phosphorylated and acetylated statusdependent manner, by binding to matrix attachment regions (MARs) of DNA and inducing a local chromatinloop remodeling. Acts as a docking site for several chromatin remodeling enzymes (e.g. PML at the MHCI locus) and also by recruiting corepressors (HDACs) or coactivators (HATs) directly to promoters and enhancers. Modulates genes that are essential in the maturation of the immune Tcell CD8SP from thymocytes. Required for the switching of fetal globin species, and beta and gammaglobin genes regulation during erythroid differentiation. Plays a role in chromatin organization and nuclear architecture during apoptosis. Interacts with the unique region (UR) of cytomegalovirus (CMV). Alulike motifs and SATB1binding sites provide a unique chromatin context which seems preferentially targeted by the HIV1 integration machinery. Moreover, HIV1 Tat may overcome SATB1 mediated repression of IL2 and IL2RA (interleukin) in Tcells by binding to the same domain than HDAC1. Delineates specific epigenetic modifications at target gene loci, directly upregulating metastasis associated genes while downregulating tumorsuppressor genes. Reprograms chromatin organization and the transcription profiles of breast tumors to promote growth and metastasis. Promotes neuronal differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells in the adult subventricular zone, possibly by positively regulating the expression of NEUROD1 ."
