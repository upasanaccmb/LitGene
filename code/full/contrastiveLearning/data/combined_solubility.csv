Although present in eukaryotes, glutaminyltRNA synthetase (QARS) is absent from many prokaryotes, mitochondria, and chloroplasts, in which GlntRNA(Gln) is formed by transamidation of the misacylated GlutRNA(Gln). GlutaminyltRNA synthetase belongs to the classI aminoacyltRNA synthetase family. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. GlutaminetRNA ligase .

CRY1,Insoluble,"This gene encodes a flavin adenine dinucleotidebinding protein that is a key component of the circadian core oscillator complex, which regulates the circadian clock. This gene is upregulated by CLOCK/ARNTL heterodimers but then represses this upregulation in a feedback loop using PER/CRY heterodimers to interact with CLOCK/ARNTL. Polymorphisms in this gene have been associated with altered sleep patterns. The encoded protein is widely conserved across plants and animals. Loss of the related gene in mouse results in a shortened circadian cycle in complete darkness. Transcriptional repressor which forms a core component of the circadian clock. The circadian clock, an internal timekeeping system, regulates various physiological processes through the generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in gene expression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism and behavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and 'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array of physiological functions including metabolism, sleep, body temperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and renal function. Consists of two major components: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain, and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissue and organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can be reset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for 'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock is light, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN. The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronal and hormonal signals, body temperature and feedingrelated cues, aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadian rhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with its environment at the molecular level by regulating gene expression to create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours to control when a particular physiological process is most active with respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation of core clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, BMAL1, BMAL2, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythm generation, whereas delays imposed by post translational modifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period (tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and is the length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm is synchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian and infradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours, respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute to the pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolic syndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop (TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism. Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and BMAL1 or BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act in the form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of core clock genes and clockcontrolled genes (involved in key metabolic processes), harboring Ebox elements (5'CACGTG3') within their promoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which are transcriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedback loop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2BMAL1|BMAL2 heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negatively regulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activates nuclear receptors NR1D1/2 and RORA/B/G, which form a second feedback loop and which activate and repress BMAL1 transcription, respectively. CRY1 and CRY2 have redundant functions but also differential and selective contributions at least in defining the pace of the SCN circadian clock and its circadian transcriptional outputs. More potent transcriptional repressor in cerebellum and liver than CRY2, though more effective in lengthening the period of the SCN oscillator. On its side, CRY2 seems to play a critical role in tuning SCN circadian period by opposing the action of CRY1. With CRY2, is dispensable for circadian rhythm generation but necessary for the development of intercellular networks for rhythm synchrony. Capable of translocating circadian clock core proteins such as PER proteins to the nucleus.

RELA,Soluble,"NFkappaB is a ubiquitous transcription factor involved in several biological processes. It is held in the cytoplasm in an inactive state by specific inhibitors. Upon degradation of the inhibitor, NFkappaB moves to the nucleus and activates transcription of specific genes. NFkappaB is composed of NFKB1 or NFKB2 bound to either REL, RELA, or RELB. The most abundant form of NFkappaB is NFKB1 complexed with the product of this gene, RELA. Four transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. NFkappaB is a pleiotropic transcription factor present in almost all cell types and is the endpoint of a series of signal transduction events that are initiated by a vast array of stimuli related to many biological processes such as inflammation, immunity, differentiation, cell growth, tumorigenesis and apoptosis. NFkappaB is a homo or heterodimeric complex formed by the Rellike domain containing proteins RELA/p65, RELB, NFKB1/p105, NFKB1/p50, REL and NFKB2/p52. The heterodimeric RELANFKB1 complex appears to be most abundant one. The dimers bind at kappaB sites in the DNA of their target genes and the individual dimers have distinct preferences for different kappaB sites that they can bind with distinguishable affinity and specificity. Different dimer combinations act as transcriptional activators or repressors, respectively. The NFkappaB heterodimeric RELANFKB1 and RELAREL complexes, for instance, function as transcriptional activators. NFkappaB is controlled by various mechanisms of posttranslational modification and subcellular compartmentalization as well as by interactions with other cofactors or corepressors. NFkappaB complexes are held in the cytoplasm in an inactive state complexed with members of the NFkappaB inhibitor (I kappaB) family. In a conventional activation pathway, IkappaB is phosphorylated by IkappaB kinases (IKKs) in response to different activators, subsequently degraded thus liberating the active NFkappaB complex which translocates to the nucleus. The inhibitory effect of I kappaB on NFkappaB through retention in the cytoplasm is exerted primarily through the interaction with RELA. RELA shows a weak DNA binding site which could contribute directly to DNA binding in the NF kappaB complex. Beside its activity as a direct transcriptional activator, it is also able to modulate promoters accessibility to transcription factors and thereby indirectly regulate gene expression. Associates with chromatin at the NFkappaB promoter region via association with DDX1. Essential for cytokine gene expression in T cells .

Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. omponent of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP2). Adaptor protein complexes function in protein transport via transport vesicles in different membrane traffic pathways.

CARD9,Soluble,"The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the CARD protein family, which is defined by the presence of a characteristic caspaseassociated recruitment domain (CARD). CARD is a protein interaction domain known to participate in activation or suppression of CARD containing members of the caspase family, and thus plays an important regulatory role in cell apoptosis. This protein was identified by its selective association with the CARD domain of BCL10, a postive regulator of apoptosis and NFkappaB activation, and is thought to function as a molecular scaffold for the assembly of a BCL10 signaling complex that activates NFkappaB. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed, but their fulllength nature is not clearly defined. Adapter protein that plays a key role in innate immune response against fungi by forming signaling complexes downstream of C type lectin receptors . CARD9 mediated signals are essential for antifungal immunity against a subset of fungi from the phylum Ascomycota . Transduces signals in myeloid cells downstream of Ctype lectin receptors CLEC7A (dectin 1), CLEC6A (dectin2) and CLEC4E (Mincle), which detect pathogen associated molecular pattern metabolites (PAMPs), such as fungal carbohydrates, and trigger CARD9 activation . Upon activation, CARD9 homooligomerizes to form a nucleating helical template that recruits BCL10 via CARDCARD interaction, thereby promoting polymerization of BCL10 and subsequent recruitment of MALT1: this leads to activation of NFkappaB and MAP kinase p38 (MAPK11, MAPK12, MAPK13 and/or MAPK14) pathways which stimulate expression of genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines . CARD9 signaling in antigenpresenting cells links innate sensing of fungi to the activation of adaptive immunity and provides a cytokine milieu that induces the development and subsequent of interleukin 17producing T helper (Th17) cells . Also involved in activation of myeloid cells via classical ITAM associated receptors and TLR: required for TLRmediated activation of MAPK, while it is not required for TLRinduced activation of NFkappaB . CARD9 can also be engaged independently of BCL10: forms a complex with RASGRF1 downstream of Ctype lectin receptors, which recruits and activates HRAS, leading to ERK activation and the production of cytokines . Acts as an important regulator of the intestinal commensal fungi (mycobiota) component of the gut microbiota . Plays an essential role in antifungal immunity against dissemination of gut fungi: acts by promoting induction of antifungal IgG antibodies response in CX3CR1(+) macrophages to confer protection against disseminated C.albicans or C.auris infection . Also mediates immunity against other pathogens, such as certain bacteria, viruses and parasites; CARD9 signaling is however redundant with other innate immune responses . In response to L.monocytogenes infection, required for the production of inflammatory cytokines activated by intracellular peptidoglycan: acts by connecting NOD2 recognition of peptidoglycan to downstream activation of MAP kinases (MAPK) without activating NF kappaB .",1

CGAS,Soluble,"Enables several functions, including 2',3'cyclic GMPAMP synthase activity; chromatin binding activity; and phosphatidylinositol4,5bisphosphate binding activity. Involved in several processes, including cellular response to exogenous dsRNA; positive regulation of intracellular signal transduction; and regulation of defense response. Located in several cellular components, including cytosol; nucleus; and site of doublestrand break. Nucleotidyltransferase that catalyzes the formation of cyclic GMPAMP (2',3'cGAMP) from ATP and GTP and plays a key role in innate immunity . Catalysis involves both the formation of a 2',5' phosphodiester linkage at the GpA step and the formation of a 3',5' phosphodiester linkage at the ApG step, producing c[G(2',5')pA(3',5')p] . Acts as a key DNA sensor: directly binds doublestranded DNA (dsDNA), inducing the formation of liquidlike droplets in which CGAS is activated, leading to synthesis of 2',3'cGAMP, a second messenger that binds to and activates STING1, thereby triggering typeI interferon production . Preferentially recognizes and binds curved long dsDNAs of a minimal length of 40 bp . Acts as a key foreign DNA sensor, the presence of doublestranded DNA (dsDNA) in the cytoplasm being a danger signal that triggers the immune responses . Has antiviral activity by sensing the presence of dsDNA from DNA viruses in the cytoplasm . Also acts as an innate immune sensor of infection by retroviruses, such as HIV2, by detecting the presence of reversetranscribed DNA in the cytosol . In contrast, HIV1 is poorly sensed by CGAS, due to its capsid that cloaks viral DNA from CGAS detection . Detection of retroviral reverse transcribed DNA in the cytosol may be indirect and be mediated via interaction with PQBP1, which directly binds reversetranscribed retroviral DNA . Also detects the presence of DNA from bacteria, such as M.tuberculosis . 2',3'cGAMP can be transferred from producing cells to neighboring cells through gap junctions, leading to promote STING1 activation and convey immune response to connecting cells . 2',3'cGAMP can also be transferred between cells by virtue of packaging within viral particles contributing to IFNinduction in newly infected cells in a cGAS independent but STING1dependent manner . Also senses the presence of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that are translocated to the cytosol following phagocytosis, leading to synthesis of 2',3'cGAMP . In addition to foreign DNA, can also be activated by endogenous nuclear or mitochondrial DNA . When selfDNA leaks into the cytosol during cellular stress (such as mitochondrial stress, SARSCoV2 infection causing severe COVID19 disease, DNA damage, mitotic arrest or senescence), or is present in form of cytosolic micronuclei, CGAS is activated leading to a state of sterile inflammation . Acts as a regulator of cellular senescence by binding to cytosolic chromatin fragments that are present in senescent cells, leading to trigger typeI interferon production via STING1 and promote cellular senescence . Also involved in the inflammatory response to genome instability and doublestranded DNA breaks: acts by localizing to micronuclei arising from genome instability . Micronuclei, which are frequently found in cancer cells, consist of chromatin surrounded by their own nuclear membrane: following breakdown of the micronuclear envelope, a process associated with chromothripsis, CGAS binds selfDNA exposed to the cytosol, leading to 2',3'cGAMP synthesis and subsequent activation of STING1 and typeI interferon production . Activated in response to prolonged mitotic arrest, promoting mitotic cell death . In a healthy cell, CGAS is however kept inactive even in cellular events that directly expose it to selfDNA, such as mitosis, when cGAS associates with chromatin directly after nuclear envelope breakdown or remains in the form of postmitotic persistent nuclear cGAS pools bound to chromatin . Nuclear CGAS is inactivated by chromatin via direct interaction with nucleosomes, which block CGAS from DNA binding and thus prevent CGASinduced autoimmunity . Also acts as a suppressor of DNA repair in response to DNA damage: inhibits homologous recombination repair by interacting with PARP1, the CGASPARP1 interaction leading to impede the formation of the PARP1TIMELESS complex . In addition to DNA, also sense translation stress: in response to translation stress, translocates to the cytosol and associates with collided ribosomes, promoting its activation and triggering typeI interferon production . In contrast to other mammals, human CGAS displays speciesspecific mechanisms of DNA recognition and produces less 2',3'cGAMP, allowing a more finetuned response to pathogens .",1

IL27,Soluble,"The protein encoded by this gene is one of the subunits of a heterodimeric cytokine complex. This protein is related to interleukin 12A (IL12A). It interacts with EpsteinBarr virus induced gene 3 (EBI3), a protein similar to interleukin 12B (IL12B), and forms a complex that has been shown to drive rapid expansion of naive but not memory CD4(+) T cells. The complex is also found to synergize strongly with interleukin 12 to trigger interferon gamma (IFNG) production of naive CD4(+) T cells. The biological effects of this cytokine are mediated by the class I cytokine receptor (WSX1/TCRR). Associates with EBI3 to form the IL27 interleukin, a heterodimeric cytokine which functions in innate immunity. IL27 has pro and antiinflammatory properties, that can regulate Thelper cell development, suppress Tcell proliferation, stimulate cytotoxic Tcell activity, induce isotype switching in Bcells, and that has diverse effects on innate immune cells. Among its target cells are CD4 Thelper cells which can differentiate in type 1 effector cells (TH1), type 2 effector cells (TH2) and IL17 producing helper Tcells (TH17). It drives rapid clonal expansion of naive but not memory CD4 Tcells. It also strongly synergizes with IL12 to trigger interferongamma/IFN gamma production of naive CD4 Tcells, binds to the cytokine receptor WSX1/TCCR which appears to be required but not sufficient for IL27 mediated signal transduction. IL27 potentiate the early phase of TH1 response and suppress TH2 and TH17 differentiation. It induces the differentiation of TH1 cells via two distinct pathways, p38 MAPK/TBX21 and ICAM1/ITGAL/ERKdependent pathways. It also induces STAT1, STAT3, STAT4 and STAT5 phosphorylation and activates TBX21/TBet via STAT1 with resulting IL12RB2 upregulation, an event crucial to TH1 cell commitment. It suppresses the expression of GATA3, the inhibitor TH1 cells development. In CD8 Tcells, it activates STATs as well as GZMB. IL27 reveals to be a potent inhibitor of TH17 cell development and of IL17 production. Indeed IL27 alone is also able to inhibit the production of IL17 by CD4 and CD8 Tcells. While IL27 suppressed the development of proinflammatory Th17 cells via STAT1, it inhibits the development of antiinflammatory inducible regulatory Tcells, iTreg, independently of STAT1. IL27 has also an effect on cytokine production, it suppresses proinflammatory cytokine production such as IL2, IL4, IL5 and IL6 and activates suppressors of cytokine signaling such as SOCS1 and SOCS3. Apart from suppression of cytokine production, IL27 also antagonizes the effects of some cytokines such as IL6 through direct effects on Tcells. Another important role of IL27 is its antitumor activity as well as its antiangiogenic activity with activation of production of antiangiogenic chemokines such as IP 10/CXCL10 and MIG/CXCL9. In vein endothelial cells, it induces IRF1/interferon regulatory factor 1 and increase the expression of MHC class II transactivator/CIITA with resulting upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class II.

PLG,Soluble,"The plasminogen protein encoded by this gene is a serine protease that circulates in blood plasma as an inactive zymogen and is converted to the active protease, plasmin, by several plasminogen activators such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), kallikrein, and factor XII (Hageman factor). The conversion of plasminogen to plasmin involves the cleavage of the peptide bond between Arg561 and Val562. Plasmin cleavage also releases the angiostatin protein which inhibits angiogenesis. Plasmin degrades many blood plasma proteins, including fibrincontaining blood clots. As a serine protease, plasmin cleaves many products in addition to fibrin such as fibronectin, thrombospondin, laminin, and von Willebrand factor. Plasmin is inactivated by proteins such as alpha2macroglobulin and alpha2antiplasmin in addition to inhibitors of the various plasminogen activators. Plasminogen also interacts with plasminogen receptors which results in the retention of plasmin on cell surfaces and in plasmininduced cell signaling. The localization of plasminogen on cell surfaces plays a role in the degradation of extracellular matrices, cell migration, inflamation, wound healing, oncogenesis, metastasis, myogenesis, muscle regeneration, neurite outgrowth, and fibrinolysis. This protein may also play a role in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which, in part, is caused by enhanced clot formation and the suppression of fibrinolysis. Compared to other mammals, the cluster of plasminogenlike genes to which this gene belongs has been rearranged in catarrhine primates.
